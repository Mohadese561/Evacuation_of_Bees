# Evacuation_of_Bees: Macroscopic model for evacuation of bees

We investigate a Hughes model for controling the evacuation of Bees on a surface in 3D . The Hughes model is a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) and consists of a nonlinear transport equation and an Eikonal equation which determines the movement direction of Bees. Indeed, the Hughes model is a continuum macroscopic model which can be simulate the global movement effects by interpreting Bees as particles of flow. Considering this model, Bees tend to choose the shortest path to reach the outlet of beehive but it may be at a slower speed. To minimize the evacuation time and control the path of Bees through the outlet,  we add a convection term  (additional driving force)  to the nonlinear transport equation.
